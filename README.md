# Bradley_Stines_Digital_resume
This project is for an assignment for my Senior Design class. The objective is to create an online resume.

My name is Bradley Stines, and I am a senior electrical engineering student at Mississippi State University. I was born in Louisianna, but I have lived in a small town in south Mississippi my entire life until leaving for school. I hope to graduate this upcoming May and start a career in some field pertaining to electrical engineering.
